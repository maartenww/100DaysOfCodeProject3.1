The chrome dinosaur game clone, in the future I will create an AI on this game with the use of genetic algorithms and neural networks.


Down here the design/scratch of my game:














chrome://dino/

1 :
Create the dinosaur chrome game clone

Definitions (* is definition)

Poll: Checks for something

Event: Mousemovements, clicking, typing etc.

Parsing: find something


Gameloop
:
1. Setup the game:
> Initialize the modules and libraries

> Instantiate the classes and some variables

> Game class with handle event method along with instantiation

> Main function which contains this loop

> if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    uninit)
  At the end of the code

> Along with alot of other classes from objects to player to birds.



--------------GAME LOOP--------------------

2. *Poll and Handle *events:

> Polls for events and responds appropiately

> If event = exit Jump to quit (Jump to number 6)

> Handle stuff like: Movement controls

> Poll data such as speed, distance between object and size of objects


3. Poll game elements and update them

> Poll data and check the data of objects such as:
    Position
    Size
    Color
    Sprite
    Rect
    Collision
    Type
    ---- As well as unique data elements f.ex:
    isDinoAlive?
    Speed
    
> Update all those elements

4. Draw the objects

> Draw the surfaces unto the screensurface

> Draw the objects

> Basically draw all the sprites

5. Show it unto the surface and jump back to number 2 for the 'game loop'


--------------GAME LOOP--------------------




6. Close the game and uninitialize everything





-------------THINGS I THINK I'LL LEARN FROM THIS PROJECT----------------
1. Spritesheets
2. Animation
3. Pygame library documentation
4. Window game scrolling
5. Physics
6. Platformers
7. Python skills
8. XML? (Might use it)
9. *Parsing? (Might use it)
